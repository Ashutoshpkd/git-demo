Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
Yeah
I don't wanna fall asleep
I don't wanna pass away
I been thinking of our future 'cause I'll never see those days
I don't know why this has happened
But I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best
But you know that I'm not perfect
I been praying for forgiveness
You've been praying for my health
When I leave this earth
Hoping you'll find someone else
'Cause yeah, we still young there's so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family
Watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me
But I won't make it off this bed
I hope I go to heaven
So I see you once again
My life was kinda short
But I got so many blessings
Happy youâ€¦
